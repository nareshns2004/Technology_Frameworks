Two of these cases involved ACORN suing Governor Jim Edgar under the new Motor Voter Act,[78][79] one involved a voter suing Mayor Daley under the Voting Rights Act,[80] and one involved, in the only case Obama orally argued, a whistleblowing stockbroker suing his former employer.[81]\\nAll of these appeals were resolved in favor of Obama's clients, with all the opinions authored by Obama's University of Chicago colleague Chief Judge Richard Posner.[82]\\nObama was a founding member of the board of directors of Public Allies in 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993.[55][83] From sixth grade through eighth grade at Punahou, Obama lived with his mother and Maya.[35][36]\\nObama's mother completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for an M.A. in anthropology in December 1974.[37] After three years in Hawaii, she and Maya returned to Jakarta in August 1975,[38] where Dunham completed her contract with the Institute of Management Education and Development and started anthropological fieldwork.[39]\\nObama chose to stay with his grandparents in Honolulu to continue his studies at Punahou School for his high school years.[8][40]\\n In the summer of 1981, Obama traveled to Jakarta to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of Occidental College friends in Hyderabad (India) and Karachi (Pakistan) for three weeks.[49]\\nHe then transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a speciality in international relations[50][51] and in English literature.[52] Obama lived off campus in a modest rented apartment at 142 West 109th Street.[53][54]\"},\n",
