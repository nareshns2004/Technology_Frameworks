# 💻 [LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llms-as-operating-systems-agent-memory/)

Welcome to the "LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory" course! 🧠 Learn how to build agents with long-term, persistent memory using **Letta**, an open-source framework for memory-enhanced LLM agents. This course is taught by **Charles Packer** and **Sarah Wooders**, co-founders of Letta, and is based on the innovative ideas presented in the MemGPT research paper.

## 📘 Course Summary
This course equips you with the skills to create AI agents that manage and edit memory autonomously, optimizing context usage for real-world applications like research and HR. Learn how to leverage **Letta** to add persistent, long-term memory to your LLM agents, enabling advanced reasoning and adaptability.

### **What You’ll Learn**
1. 🔄 **Agent Memory Management**: Build agents with self-editing memory, utilizing tool-calling and multi-step reasoning.
2. 🛠️ **Using Letta Framework**: Explore Letta’s features for adding memory capabilities to LLMs, including core and archival memory.
3. 🧩 **MemGPT Concepts**: Understand the key ideas behind MemGPT, including two-tier memory systems and how agent states are converted into prompts.
4. 🤝 **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Learn to implement collaborative agents by sharing memory blocks and exchanging messages.

### **Practical Applications**
- 🔍 **Conversation Memory Control**: Manage expanding conversations by summarizing and moving less relevant information to a searchable database, ensuring smooth context flow.
- 📂 **Persistent Fact Storage**: Save and edit details like names, dates, and preferences for future interactions.
- 📑 **Task-Specific Memory**: Develop agents capable of swapping context-relevant information in real-time from a database for tasks like research.

## 🔑 Key Points
- 🧠 **Enhanced Memory Management**: Use Letta to create agents with long-term, persistent memory and advanced reasoning capabilities.
- 📋 **Efficient Context Optimization**: Optimize LLM context window usage to reduce costs and improve processing speed.
- 🤖 **Collaboration Between Agents**: Enable multi-agent systems that share memory and collaborate seamlessly.
